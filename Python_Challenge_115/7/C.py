Statement
It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.

Example input
1 5
2 3
3 1
4 7
5 2
6 8
7 6
8 4
(shown on the picture)

Example output
NO
